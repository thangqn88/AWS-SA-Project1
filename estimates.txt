For developing DR plan, there are two key metrics that we must be considerd
- Recovery time objective (RTO) => how many hours it takes you to return to a working state after a disaster.
- Recovery point objective (RPO) => how many hours you could lose the data when a disaster happens.

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
For this scenario, the minimum RTO is typically 60â€“120 seconds. Ref url: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.Failover.html

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
In this scenario, the timing requires below steps:
- Starting up a new Amazon RDS instance
- Applying all changes since the last backup. 30 mins to 1 hour.
- Manual intervention.
    -- Use existing replica and promote to master. ~10mins
    -- Verify newly promoted database is working correctly. ~ 2mins (Time to recover DB ~15mins)
    -- Verify application can connect to database ~2mins
    -- Reconfigure the application to point to new DB instance. ~ 30mins
    -- Checks to ensure application is working correctly ~5mins

Estimated min RTO for single-region outage: ~60mins

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- In Multi-AZ scenario, automatic backups are enabled. It means AWS will take full snapshot once a day.
- Assuming web-server continued to serve requests for 60-120sec until database failover completed
=> Minimum RPO for a single AZ is 5 minutes.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- In Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode, database is updated asynchronously between Primary and read replica.
- it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state (for initial setup and installation time). 
=> Minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.
